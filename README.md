# Why did I choose to build this project?
It is a multi-page space tourism website. It was a great challenge to test my layout skill and little bit of animation and react-routing as well.

I have been learning how to make a page or website responsive for different screens so I decided to go with this project to test it out.

## What did I implement in this project

- I have impleted routing to naviagate to different pages.
- Responsive layout which works on different screen size. approch used was mobile first approch 
- Hover effects and transitions to make things look smooth

## Lessons learned
- Creating common css classes and reusing them saves a lot of time and efforts.
- Resusing react components.

There is lot of scope of improvment like background image is streching on change of screen size.
